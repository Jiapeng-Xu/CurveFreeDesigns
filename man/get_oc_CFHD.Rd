\code{get_oc_CFHD} returns the operating characteristics of the CFHD design as a list,
including:
(1) \code{$percentFound}: the percentage of trials recommending BEDs
(2) \code{$percentCorrect}: within those trials recommending BEDs, the percentage of trials of which all recommended doses are truly admissible and acceptable
(3) \code{$percentSuccess}: within those trials recommending BEDs, the percentage of trials of which the sample pooled efficacy rate being above \code{E.min}
(4) \code{$percentToxicity}: the percentage of in-trial toxicities
(5) \code{$percentEfficacy}: the percentage of in-trial efficacies
(6) \code{$averageSampleSize}: the average sample size over all simulated trials
(7) \code{$percentMTD}: the selection percentages of MTD
(8) \code{$percentL}: the selection percentages of lower boundary of BEDs interval
(9) \code{$percentU}: the selection percentages of upper boundary of BEDs interval
(10) \code{$percentPatients}: patient allocation for all doses under CFHD

\description{
Obtain the operating characteristics of the CFHD design by simulation
}
\details{
The operating characteristics of the CFHD design are generated by simulating trials under the prespecified true toxicity and efficacy probabilities.
We assume that the dose-toxicity curve is monotonic non-decreasing and the dose-efficacy curve is unimodal.
In phase Ia stage, a Bayesian model on the toxicity rates is used to locate the maximum tolerated doese.
In phase Ib stage, we model the dose-efficacy curve using a step function while continuing to monitor the toxicity rates.
At the end of phase Ib, if some doses are recommended as BEDs, a cohort of confirmation is recruited and assigned at these doses to improve the precision of estimates at these doses.
