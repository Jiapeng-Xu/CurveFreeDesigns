\value{
\code{getoc()} returns the operating characteristics of the CFBD design as a list,
        including:
        (1) \code{$percentFound}: the percentage of trials recommending BEDs
        (2) \code{$percentCorrect}: within those trials recommending BEDs, the percentage of trials of which all recommended doses are truly admissible and acceptable
        (3) \code{$percentSuccess}: within those trials recommending BEDs, the percentage of trials of which the sample pooled efficacy rate being above \code{E.min}
        (4) \code{$percentToxicity}: the percentage of in-trial toxicities
        (5) \code{$percentEfficacy}: the percentage of in-trial efficacies
        (6) \code{$averageSampleSize}: the average sample size over all simulated trials
        (7) \code{$percentMTD}: the selection percentages of MTD
        (8) \code{$percentL}: the selection percentages of lower boundary of BEDs interval
        (9) \code{$percentU}: the selection percentages of upper boundary of BEDs interval
        (10) \code{$percentPatients}: patient allocation for all doses under CFBD
}
\description{
Conduct sensitivity analysis by adding random errors to the means of the Beta prior distributions to investigate the robustness of CFBD. The random errors follow uniform distribution from \code{lower} to \code{upper}.
