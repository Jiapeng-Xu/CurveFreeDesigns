\title{Terminate the phase Ia trial whenever the evidence for the current conclusion is considered sufficient}
\usage{
stopmtd(a.vec, b.vec, mtd, target, T.max, p1, p2)
}
\arguments{
\item{a.vec}{parameter alpha for current prior distribution}

\item{b.vec}{parameter beta for current prior distribution}

\item{mtd}{the MTD candidate}

\item{target}{the target toxicity level}

\item{T.max}{the absolute overly toxic level, usually .05 above target}

\item{p1}{the error rate for concluding inadmissible; .10 is suggested}

\item{p2}{the error rate for concluding admissible; .10 is suggested}
}
\value{
\code{stopmtd()} returns (1) flag_stop: Boolean value indicating whether we should terminate the phase Ia trial and; (2) flag_mtd: Boolean value indicating whether we have sufficient evidence that the current MTD is the true MTD
}
\description{
Stop if (1) out of patients n = n_{max} or; (2) the current recommended dose is very likely to be the MTD or; (3) all doses are evidently too toxic. Use working data (see function workdata) instead of real data for small samples
}
\details{
\code{stopmtd()} performs the following stopping rule:
         (1) stop, if the current recommended dose is very likely to be the MTD:
             (a) if the current recommended dose is the highest dose: if the posterior probability of the current MTD being the true MTD exceeds a threshold, we conclude that the current MTD is the true MTD
             (b) if the current recommended dose is not the highest dose: if the posterior probability of the next higher dose being too toxic exceeds a threshold, we conclude that the current MTD is the true MTD
         (2) stop, if all doses are evidently too toxic:
             (a) if the posterior probability of the first dose being overly toxic exceeds a threshold, we conclude that the MTD is below the first dose
